      "title": "Hello orcs",
      "body": "The orcs are a prolific and physically powerful race hailing from the once-lush world of Draenor, now known as the shattered realm of Outland. Originally a shamanistic people cultivating a primitive clan-based society, the orcs were corrupted by Kil'jaeden—a demon lord of the Burning Legion—and manipulated into forming a bloodthirsty Horde that waged war on the peaceful draenei race. Rampant demonic corruption caused the orcs to be filled with bloodlust and turned their normally brown skin into shades of green, culminating with Kil'jaeden's servant Gul'dan convincing the orc chieftains to drink the blood of the demon Mannoroth and thereby enslaving them to the Burning Legion's will. The few orcs who escaped the corruption became known as mag'har (\"uncorrupted\").\n\nAfter conquering Draenor, the Horde invaded the world of Azeroth through the Dark Portal and waged war upon the world's native kingdoms, until Azeroth's nations united into an Alliance of Lordaeron that managed to defeat the invaders and enslave most of the survivors. Yet, the shamanistic tradition of the orcs managed to rekindle from the ashes as a young shaman named Thrall arose to become warchief and lead his people in their darkest hour. He reunited the clans into a new Horde and led the orcs out of the Eastern Kingdoms they had been forced to invade and into the continent of Kalimdor, where the orcs finally freed themselves from demonic corruption and briefly united with Azeroth's other races to stand against an invasion of the Burning Legion. Seeking to begin a new existence on Kalimdor for themselves and other newfound member races of the Horde, the orcs founded the nation of Durotar and the great city of Orgrimmar.\n\nAs time passed, conflicts between the Alliance and Horde reemerged. During the Cataclysm, Thrall passed leadership of the Horde to the reckless Garrosh Hellscream, whose actions plunged the Horde into civil war. After being deposed, Hellscream traveled to an alternate Draenor in the time before the original Horde's invasion of Azeroth. There, he rallied the orc clans into an Iron Horde—free of demonic corruption but still bent on conquest—to invade the main universe's Azeroth. History ultimately repeated itself as the Iron Horde succumbed to the Burning Legion's will before being defeated by the forces of Azeroth, with the uncorrupted remnants of the Iron Horde subsequently renaming themselves Mag'har. Years later, these uncorrupted orcs were recruited into Azeroth's Horde and joined their main universe brethren.",

      "title": "Hello Elf",
      "body": "An elf is a long-lived humanoid species native to Azeroth known for keen perception, grace, and great spellwork. They are one of the longest-lived species on Azeroth. The specific origins of elves remained lost to history for millennia,[2] until Brann Bronzebeard confirmed that the first elves were originally dark trolls that were transformed by the Well of Eternity.[3]\n\nElves come in many flavors in Azeroth, the four most dominant of which are playable races in World of Warcraft: night elves and void elves for the Alliance, and blood elves and nightborne for the Horde.",
